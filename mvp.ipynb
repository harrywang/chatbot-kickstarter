    "# Power your products with ChatGPT and your own data\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a walkthrough taking readers through how to build starter Q&A and Chatbot applications using the ChatGPT API and their own data. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is laid out in these sections:\n",
    "- **Setup:** \n",
    "    - Initiate variables and source the data\n",
    "- **Lay the foundations:**\n",
    "    - Set up the vector database to accept vectors and data\n",
    "    - Load the dataset, chunk the data up for embedding and store in the vector database\n",
    "- **Make it a product:**\n",
    "    - Add a retrieval step where users provide queries and we return the most relevant entries\n",
    "    - Summarise search results with GPT-3\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Q&A app in Streamlit\n",
    "- **Build your moat:**\n",
    "    - Create an Assistant class to manage context and interact with our bot\n",
    "    - Use the Chatbot to answer questions using semantic search context\n",
    "    - Test out this basic Chatbot app in Streamlit\n",
    "    \n",
    "Upon completion, you have the building blocks to create your own production chatbot or Q&A application using OpenAI APIs and a vector database.\n",
